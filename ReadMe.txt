This code has been designed to run on the Cloudera VM that is made available as part of BDTT course and has the following requirements/limitations:

1. It requires a minimum of 10 gigs of RAM and a quad core processor with hyperthreading (the VM needs at least 6 virtual cores to run). 
2. SQL data to be made available in TAR format (as uploaded on the course website). 
3. The default passwords are as set on the BDTT class VM. 
4. It is assumed that all the necessary services have been started using the training_setup_dev1.sh and Hive-server2 is up and running (sudo service hive-server2 start)
5. Please run ./runall.sh in shell to start executing the code and be patient. The code can take several minutes to execute to completion.
